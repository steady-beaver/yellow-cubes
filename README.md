# Portfolio with yellow cubes

### Simple static website that demonstrates fundamental skills

- Written in plain **html, css, js**
- Used js library **[gsap](https://greensock.com/gsap/)** for the intro animation 
- Javascript 3d perspective feature to make interactive rotating cube
- Responsive mobile website
- Design made with **Figma**

##### My comments
- This is my second fully functioning deployed site. Now I would position elements with css grid (not position relative). During time of the site creation I didn't know that css grid exist.
- GSAP turned out to be intuitive, easy to use animation library that refined the project.
- JS 3d module was hard to implement, because it disrupts the screen perspective. Thus I needed to adjust manually several css properties which was tedious job.
